===========


Do you have slow dependency install time? Are you impatient wait for project build? Do you feel anxious while waiting for a long deploy to finish? Just sit back and listen to some smooth jazz while your terminal ticks away

*Note:* Only OS X support at the moment due to `afplay` working better than all the node mp3 libraries I could find.
